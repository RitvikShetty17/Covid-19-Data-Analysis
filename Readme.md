COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and derive key insights from a COVID-19 dataset containing worldwide data. The analysis aims to:
•	Understand the spread and impact of COVID-19 globally.
•	Analyze trends related to total cases, recoveries, active cases, and deaths.
•	Provide data-driven insights using visualization techniques.
•	Build a comprehensive dashboard for quick reference and decision-making support.

Project Description
This project involves detailed analysis of COVID-19 data sourced from a globally recognized database. The dataset includes country-level breakdowns of total cases, recoveries, deaths, and new cases, along with some derived metrics like recovery rate, death rate, and weekly changes.
What I Did:
•	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Removed inconsistencies, handled missing values, and prepared data for analysis.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generated statistical summaries, trends, and patterns using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
•	KPI Calculation: Calculated key performance indicators such as:
o	Recovery rate per 100 cases
o	Death rate per 100 cases
o	Weekly percentage changes in cases
•	Dashboard Creation: Built an interactive dashboard using Excel to allow dynamic filtering and visualization of data by country, WHO region, and other categories.
•	Insights Generation: Identified top affected countries, weekly trends, and regions with highest recovery/death rates.

Problem It Solves
•	Helps policymakers and public health authorities monitor COVID-19 statistics effectively.
•	Enables quick identification of countries/regions with high or low recovery and death rates.
•	Provides an analytical foundation for understanding weekly trends and outbreak control effectiveness.
•	Assists in data storytelling through visual dashboards for non-technical stakeholders.
